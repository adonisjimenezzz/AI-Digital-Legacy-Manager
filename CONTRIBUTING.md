Licensed
This repository uses a tool called Licensed to verify third party dependencies. You may need to locally install licensed and run licensed cache to update the dependency cache if you install or update a production dependency. If licensed cache is unable to determine the dependency, you may need to modify the cache file yourself to put the correct license. You should still verify the dependency, licensed is a tool to help, but is not a substitute for human review of dependencies.
